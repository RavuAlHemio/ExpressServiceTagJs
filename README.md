# ExpressServiceTagJs

A JavaScript (okay, TypeScript) implementation to convert between Dell's *Service Tags* and *Express Service Tags*
(previously *Express Service Codes*).

Most web-based converters perform a server-side conversion, which I have found insufficiently trustworthy. This
converter performs all calculations in the browser.

Also contains a rather simplistic large-integer implementation called `BadBignum`.
